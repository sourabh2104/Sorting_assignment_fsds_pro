    "\n",
    "Creating a Set of Squares:\n",
    "The function find_pythagorean_triplet takes an array arr as input. It initializes a set called arr_squares to store the squares of the array elements. This set will be used for efficient lookups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterating Through Pairs:\n",
    "The algorithm uses a nested loop to iterate through pairs of array elements (i, j), starting from the first element and moving to the last. This nested iteration considers all possible combinations of pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the Sum of Squares:\n",
    "For each pair (i, j), the algorithm calculates the sum of squares (\n",

    " \n",
    "+\n",
    "j\n",
    "2\n",
    " \n",
    ") and checks if this sum is present in the set of squares (arr_squares). This is done by checking if sum_of_squares is in arr_squares.\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning the Result:\n",
    "If a Pythagorean triplet is found (i.e., if the sum of squares is present in the set), the triplet (i, j, k) is returned, where k is the square root of the sum of squares. If no triplet is found after iterating through all pairs, the function returns None.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Usage:\n",
    "The algorithm is demonstrated with the example array [3, 1, 4, 6, 5]. The result is printed, and in this case, the output will be Pythagorean triplet found: (3, 4, 5) since \n",
